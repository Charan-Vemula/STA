LUT in the class circuit as parent 

LUTlist in the class circuit and dictionary in the class circuit 

Output Capacitance of the interior nodes is based on the fanouts of the gates summation of all the fanouts input capacitance


One cell delay function is enough = > goes by the equation find the index which is just lower to it 

How to do ??
    ---> First find out delays of each gate 
        ---> Add the inputs to a queue
            ---> Check if node at top is input
                ---> Add the arrival time as 0 and slew as the given value 
                ---> Add the fanout of the nodes which are not itself to the queue
            ---> else if the node at top has all inputs(fanins) with arrival time
                ---> if ready pop it and find delay
                    ---> Add the fanout of the nodes which are not itself to the queue
                ---> else add it to the queue
        
    ---> Find required arrival times and slacks of each gate 
        ---> Add all the outputs to a queue
            ---> Check if node at top is output
                ---> Add the required arrival time as the 1.1 times delay and findout slack
                ---> Add the fanin of the nodes which are not itself as inputs.
            ---> else if the node at top has all fanouts with required arrival time
                ---> if ready pop it and find required arrival time and slacks.
                    ---> add the fanin of the nodes which are not itself to the queue
                ---> else add it to the queue
    

    ---> Pick the nodes with least slacks from the output
